Hi, I am Manan Kasturia, currently a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi.
This project was developed by me in three days after I started with javascript, a week before. This was developed for the web development task given for the recruitment process of BYTE society of MAIT.
I learned a lot of new things and got hands on exprience of working with APIs and deploying a website. I got to learn about authentication with GitHub and YouTube APIs.
This project is done with Nodejs and Express framework at the server side.
In this project, it checks that if a user is following BYTE society's GitHub account or subscribed to BYTE society's YouTube channel or not. If they are followed or subscribed, they are redirected to the private route.
If not, they are asked to either follow BYTE's GitHub account or subscribe the BYTE's YouTube channel.
The middleware used in the project include passport.js, passport-github2 and passport-google-oauth20.
I have deployed the project on render and it is now live at https://byte-github-and-youtube-web-dev-task.onrender.com
(For now, I have reached the api limit for github, so authentication with github will give an error. You can still do authentication with youtube though. Will update as soon as the github api is back up.)
